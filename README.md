#Analysis of Vdr gene plymorphism of foc1 and bsm1 variants Data:

2 influenza cases, one with kidney cancer, the other healthy, analysis of the frequency of polymorphisms.
The VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) gene encodes a protein called the vitamin D receptor (VDR). 
The vitamin D receptor is a protein that plays a key role in regulating the cellular response to vitamin D.
The association of VDR gene polymorphisms with the risk of breast cancer (Bsm1, Fok1), prostate cancer (Fok1) and malignant melanoma (Fok1) is indicated. 
The greatest importance in prognosis is observed in patients with prostate cancer (Fok1), breast cancer (Bsm1, Taq1), malignant melanoma (Bsm1) and renal cell carcinoma (Taq1). 
It is important to recognize, describe and correlate the genetic occurrence of VDR gene polymorphisms, 
which will allow for early diagnosis or prevention of the occurrence of diseases correlated with them.

Relationship between polymorphisms of the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor and the risk of Parkinson's disease - a meta-analysis


Entry:
Research on the relationship between the VDR (vitamin D receptor) gene and Parkinson's disease is still in the exploratory phase, but there is growing interest in this issue. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nervous system, especially the area responsible for motor control.

Some research suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease. Since the vitamin D receptor is a key element in the process of absorption and use of this vitamin by the body, there is a hypothesis that the VDR gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Objective:
The aim of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of VDR gene polymorphisms on the risk of Parkinson's disease

Materials and methods:

In order to conduct a thorough meta-analysis, a key step is a thorough search of the available literature. In order to collect appropriate materials for analysis, we searched reputable databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Reserchgate. A combination of relevant keywords such as "VDR gene", "Polymorphisms":, "Parkinson", was used to identify potential articles. After searching the database, we obtained an original number of 66 potential articles. We then analyzed titles and abstracts, eliminating articles unrelated to the research topic and those that did not meet previously established criteria.

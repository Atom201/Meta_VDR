##Analysis of Vdr gene plymorphism of foc1 and bsm1 variants Data:

2 influenza cases, one with kidney cancer, the other healthy, analysis of the frequency of polymorphisms.
The VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) gene encodes a protein called the vitamin D receptor (VDR). 
The vitamin D receptor is a protein that plays a key role in regulating the cellular response to vitamin D.
The association of VDR gene polymorphisms with the risk of breast cancer (Bsm1, Fok1), prostate cancer (Fok1) and malignant melanoma (Fok1) is indicated. 
The greatest importance in prognosis is observed in patients with prostate cancer (Fok1), breast cancer (Bsm1, Taq1), malignant melanoma (Bsm1) and renal cell carcinoma (Taq1). 
It is important to recognize, describe and correlate the genetic occurrence of VDR gene polymorphisms, 
which will allow for early diagnosis or prevention of the occurrence of diseases correlated with them.
